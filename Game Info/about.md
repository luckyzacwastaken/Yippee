Blinding lights beam into your eyes.
As your vision starts to clear, you start your journey.
Who knows what you will encounter.

The choice is yours.

You find yourself stuck in a hotel, in the middle of the “Furpocalypse”. Your objective is to fight your way out.
Combat is fast-paced, so expect no mercy.
